# -- These lines are always needed, but the user can modify temp (temperature) and iofrq (output frequency)

variable temp equal 500

# -- These lines are always needed, but the data file name should be updated (following the case-x.indep-y.data.in convention) to match the in.lammps file's case/indep

#### Initiate dynamics and set i/o

#    1. The timestep
#    2. Which fix is used, provided ${temp} is used to set the temperature
#    3. The dump modify element line

#    5. The number of steps to run
