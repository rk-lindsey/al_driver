For each case there is an INCAR files which determines the input to VASP, in general the current INCARS should work but NPAR may need to be changed.
The INCARS are located in /examples/hydrogen/ALL_BASE_FILES/QM_BASEFILES
The number of processors being ran on needs to be divisable by NPAR (if you have 16 processors, NPAR could be 1,2,4,8,16)
The best value to set it to is the sqrt of n (4 for above example) 
NPAR needs to be set for each CASE, 2 for this hydrogen example
