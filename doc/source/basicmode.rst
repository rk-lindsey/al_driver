  **Fig. 1:** The ChIMES Active Learning Driver Workflow.

The "active learning" portion of the ALD largely entails intelligent strategies for selecting candidate unlabeled training data (step 5 in the schematic above). However, the ALD can also be run in a simpler iterative refinement scheme, which is quite efficient for low complexity non-reactive problems. In this page, a single-state-point fit is demonstrated using VASP, and all additional options for fitting in this model are overviewed.

Briefly:

* ``ALL_BASE_FILES/ALC-0_BASEFILES`` contains files specifying how step 2 of figure 1 should be run, i.e., model hyperparameters (``fm_setup.in``), a list of training configuration files (``traj_list.dat``), and in this case, a single initial training configuration file (``liquid_6000K_2.0gcc.xyzf``). 
* The ``ALL_BASE_FILES/CHIMESMD_BASEFILES`` directory contains files specifying how step 3 of figure 1 should be run, i.e., simulation parameters (``case-0.indep-0.run_md.in``), initial system configurations for simulation (``case-0.indep-0.input.xyz``), and hyperparameters for simulation output post-processing (``bonds.dat`` VERIFY RUN MOLANAL IS NEEDED ... CAN MOVE IT INTO AL DRIVER FILES). 
* The ``ALL_BASE_FILES/QM_BASEFILES`` directory contains files specifying how step 6 of figure 1 should be run, i.e., quantum calculation instructions (``6000.INCAR``), psuedopotential files (``C.POTCAR``), and a K-point file (``KPOINTS``). 
* the ``config.py`` provides high-level instructions on how *all* steps in figure 1 should be run.

A detailed description of the files in ``ALL_BASE_FILES/ALC-0_BASEFILES`` and ``ALL_BASE_FILES/CHIMESMD_BASEFILES`` can be found in the `ChIMES LSQ manual <https://chimes-lsq.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html>`_. 


.. Tip ::

    In ``fm_setup.in``, 3-and-greater polnomial orders are given as n+1. In the following example, a 3-body order of 4 is desired, hence a value of n+1 = 5 is given in the example ``fm_setup.in``.

------------------------------------------
Running
------------------------------------------

Depending on standard queuing times for your system, the ALD could take quite some time (e.g., hours) finish. For this reason it is generally, it is recommended to run the ALD from within a screen session on your HPC system. To do so, log into your HPC system and execute the following commands:

.. code-block :: bash

    $: cd /path/to/my/example/files
    $: screen 
    $: unbuffer python3 /path/to/your/ald/installation/main.py 0 1 2 3 | tee driver-0.log
    

If ``unbuffer`` is not implemented on your HPC system, use ``python3 -u`` instead. 
Note that in the final line above, the sequence of numbers indicates 3 active learning cycles will be run (i.e., the ``0`` is ignored but required when simple iterative refinement mode is selected), and ``| tee driver.log`` sends all output to both the screen and a file named driver.log. 

.. Tip :: 
    
    To detach from the screen session, execute ``ctrl a`` followed by ``ctrl d``. You can now log out of the HPC system without dirupting the ALD. Be sure to take note of which node you were logged into. You can reattach to the session later by logging into the same node and executing ``screen -r``

.. For simplicity this documentation will describe all other features as they are executed in this basic mode. Active learning features are described in **SECTION**, and **SECTION** provides an option compatibility table. 


------------------------------------------
Inspecting the output
------------------------------------------

.. Warning::

   When running the Active Learning Driver, ALWAYS read through the resulting log file carefully. If driver sets a large number of default parameters if the user does not specify them manually, which may or many not be conducive to the user's end goal. The top portion of the log file tells the user every default that it sets. 


Once the ALD has finished running, execute the following commands:

.. code-block :: bash

    $: cd /path/to/examples/simple_iter_single_statepoint/
    $: for i in {1..3}; do cd ALC-${i}/GEN_FF; paste b_comb.txt force.txt > compare.txt; cd -; done
    
Then, plot ``ALC-{3,2,1}/GEN_FF/compare.txt`` with your favorite plotting software. This file may contain force, energy, and stress values. For a force-only fit, the resulting figure should look like the following:

.. figure:: compare-simple_iter_single_statepoint.png
     :width: 400
     :align: center
  
     **Fig. 2:** ALD fitting force pairty plot.


This force parity plot provides DFT-assigned per-atom forces on the x-axis, and corresponding ChIMES predicted forces on the y-axis, in kcal/mol/Angstrom. The ALC-1 data corresponds to data generated by DFT (i.e., the forces contained in ``liquid_6000K_2.0gcc.xyzf``); the ALC-2 data contain everything from ALC-1, as well as forces for the ChIMES-generated configurations selected in step 5 of figure 1, which were assigned DFT forces in step 6 of figure 1. The ALC-3 data is structured similarly.

Next, plot the ``ALC-{1..3}/CASE-0_INDEP_0/md_statistics.out`` files. If LAMMPS is used to run molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, plot the ``etotal`` values from ``log.lammps`` instead. The resulting figure should look like the following:

.. figure:: econs-simple_iter_single_statepoint.png
     :width: 400
     :align: center
  

     **Fig. 3:** Conserved quantity for ChIMES molecular dynamics (MD) during ALD iterations.


This figure shows how the conserved quantity varies during ChIMES-MD NVT simulations using the models generated at each ALC. As expected due to the minimal initial training set, dynamics with the ALC-1 model are very unstable (i.e., varying by 55 kcal/mol/atom over 60 ps). Stability is signficantly improved by ALC-2, with the conserved quantity varying by only ~2 kcal/mol/atom. By ALC-3, the model is fully stable, varying by less than .01 kca/mol/atom over the 60 ps trajectory).

========================================================
In-depth Setup and Options Overview
========================================================


------------------------------------------
Setting up Steps 1 & 2
------------------------------------------

As with a standard ChIMES fit (see e.g, the `ChIMES LSQ manual <https://chimes-lsq.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html>`_), model generation must begin with selecting an intial training set and specifying fitting hyperparameters. In the ALD, this involves the following files, at a minimum:

.. code-block :: text

    <my_fit>/ALL_BASE_FILES/ALC-0_BASEFILES/fm_setup.in
    <my_fit>/ALL_BASE_FILES/ALC-0_BASEFILES/traj_list.dat
    <my_fit>/ALL_BASE_FILES/ALC-0_BASEFILES/*xyzf
    <my_fit>/config.py

The ``fm_setup.in`` file is created as usual, except:

* The ``# TRJFILE #`` option must be set to ``MULTI traj_list.dat`` 
* The ``# SPLITFI #`` option must be set to ``false``.

See the `ChIMES LSQ manual <https://chimes-lsq.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html>`_ for more information on what these settings control.

.. Warning ::

    Arbitrary specification of fit hyperparameters (i.e., set in ``fm_setup.in``) **will** result in inaccurate and/or unstable models. For more information on ChIMES hyperparameters and selection strategies, see: 

    * The ChIMES LSQ code manual `(link) <https://chimes-lsq.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html>`_
    * R.K. Lindsey, L.E. Fried, N. Goldman, *JCTC*, **13**, 6222 (2017) `(link) <https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jctc.7b00867>`_
    * R.K. Lindsey, L.E. Fried, N. Goldman, *JCTC* **15** 436 (2019) `(link) <https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jctc.8b00831>`_


The ``traj_list.dat`` file should be structured as usual for ChIMES LSQ, but lines containing the first n-cases entries should have a temperature in Kelvin specified at the very end, where n-cases is the number of statepoints the user would like to simultaneously conduct iterative training to:

.. code-block :: text

    3
    10 1000K_1.0gcc.xyzf 1000
    10 2000K_2.0gcc.xyzf 2000
    10 3000K_3.5gcc.xyzf 3000
    
Note that the above .xyzf files correspond to ``<my_fit>/ALL_BASE_FILES/ALC-0_BASEFILES/*xyzf``.
    

        
Finally, options for this first phase of fitting ``config.py`` must be specified. A complete set of options and details default values are listed on the `ALD Configuration File Options <https://al-driver.readthedocs.io/en/latest/options.html>`_ page. Note that for this basic overview we will assume:

* The user is running on a SLURM/SBATCH based HPC system (**set by default**)
* The HPC system has 36 processors per compute node (**set by default**)
* We want to generate hydrogen parameters by iteratively fitting at 3 statepoints, simultaneously (**indicated by line 6-7**).


The example ``config.py`` lines necessary for steps 1 & 2 are provided in the code block below. Recalling that ALD functions primarily as a workflow tool, it must be linked with external software. Here, we tell the ALD:

* What element system we are running ALD on (line 7),
* How many statepoints are we fitting to simultaneously (line 8),
* Where the ALD source code is located (line 10),
* Where the ALD will be run (line 11), and 
* Where to find our ChIMES_LSQ installation (line 12). 

Lines 18-21 tell the ALD where all the files needed to run chimes_lsq are, specifically:

* The ChIMES LSQ input files, ``fm_setup.in`` and ``traj_list.dat`` (line 18),
* The ChIMES LSQ design matrix generation executable, chimes_lsq  (line 19),
* The ChIMES LSQ matrix solution script, chimes_lsq.py (line 20), and 
* The ChIMES LSQ parameter file scrubber, post_proc_chimes_lsq.py (line 21).

Finally, lines 25-27 specify how forces, energies, and stresses should be weighted, while lines 29-31 specify how the matrix solution problem should be executed, i.e., using distributed lasso (line 29) with a regularization variable of 1e-8 (line 30), and with a normalized design matrix (line 31). Note that there are *many* options for these lines, described in detail in the `ALD Configuration File Options <https://al-driver.readthedocs.io/en/latest/options.html>`_ page.

------------------------------------------
Setting up Step 3
------------------------------------------

Step 3 comprises MD simulation with the parameters generated in step 2. Beyond the parameter file, this requires the following at a minimum:


* An initial coordinate file,
* A MD input file specifying the simulation style,
* A MD code executable, and 
* Instructions on how to post-process resultant trajectories

Recalling that the current example concerns concurrent iterative fitting for three cases (training state points), this is specified by the following in ``/path/to/ALL_BASE_FILES/CHIMESMD_BASEFILES/`` and ``config.py``, i.e.:

.. code-block :: text

    $: ls /path/to//ALL_BASE_FILES/CHIMESMD_BASEFILES/

    MOLANAL         = "/path/to/molanlal/folder/"
    MOLANAL_SPECIES = ["H1", "H2 1(H-H)", "H3 2(H-H)"]


Each ``case-*.indep-0.input.xyz`` is a ChIMES ``.xyz`` file containing initial coordinates for the system of interest for the corresponding case, while each ``case-*.indep-0.run_md.in`` is the corresponding ChIMES MD input file. Note that ``case-*.indep-0.run_md.in`` options ``# PRMFILE #`` and ``# CRDFILE #`` should be set to ``WILL_AUTO_UPDATE``. For more information on these files, see the `(ChIMES LSQ manual) <https://chimes-lsq.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html>`_. The bonds.dat file will be described below.

In the config.py file snipped above, lines 5 and 6 tell the ALD to use ChIMES MD for MD simulation runs, and provides a path to the MPI-enabled and serial compilations. Lines 9 and 10 provide information on how to post-process the trajectory. Specifically, the ALD will use the a molecular analyzer `("molanal") <https://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/ja808196e>`_ to determine speciation for the generated MD trajectories. Once speciation is determined, the ALD will provide a summary of lifetimes and molefractions for species listed in ``MOLANAL_SPECIES``. Note that the species names must match the "Molecule type" fields produced by molanal *exactly*. These strings are usually determined by running molanal on DFT-MD trajectories, prior to any ALD. Finally, the ``bonds.dat`` file specifies bond length and lifetime criteria for molanal. See the molanal ``readme.txt`` file for additional information. Be sure to verify specified bonds.dat lifetime criteria are consistent with the timestep and output frequency specified in ``case-*.indep-0.run_md.in``

-------

------------------------------------------
Setting up Step 4
------------------------------------------

Model validation is purposefully left to the user, as optimal strategies are still an active area of research and are most efficient when application-specific. The user is encouraged to investigate fit performance and physical property recovery on their own. 

-------

------------------------------------------
Setting up Step 5
------------------------------------------

Candidate configuration filtering is conducted in step 5. For basic fitting mode, this simply comprises selecting a subset of configurations generated during the previous MD step for single point evaluation using, e.g., DFT. This is handled entirely automatically by the ALD.

For basic iterative refinement mode, this entails selecting up to 20 evenly spaced configurations from ChIMES-MD simulations at each case, for which all atoms are:

1. Outside the penalty function kick-in region
2. Within the penalty function kick-in region but outside the inner cutoffs

The latter configurations are included to inform the short-ranged region of the interaction potential, which is generally poorly sampled by DFT-MD.

-------

------------------------------------------
Setting up Step 6
------------------------------------------

Step 6 comprises single point evaluation of configurations selected in step 5 via the user's requested quantum-based reference method. In this overview, we will assume the user is employing VASP but additional options are described in :ref:`Options page <page-options>`. To do so, the following must be provided, at a minimum:

.. code-block :: text

    <my_fit>/ALL_BASE_FILES/QM_BASEFILES/*.INCAR
    <my_fit>/ALL_BASE_FILES/QM_BASEFILES/KPOINTS
    <my_fit>/ALL_BASE_FILES/QM_BASEFILES/*.POTCAR

and

    ################################
    ##### Single-Point QM

    VASP_PPN     = 36
    VASP_MODULES = "mkl intel/18.0.1 impi/2018.0"
    
    
There should be one ``*.INCAR`` file for each case temperature, i.e. ``{1000,2000,3000}.INCAR`` for the present example, with all options set to user desired values for single point evaluation. Note that ``IALGO = 48`` should be used to specifiy the electronic minimization algorithm, and any variable related to restart should be set to the corresponding "new" value. There should also be one ``.*POTCAR`` file for each atom type considered, i.e. H.POTCAR for the present example.

.. Note ::

    Support for additional data labeling schemes (i.e., both quantum- and moleuclar mechanics-based) are incoming.
    
.. Tip ::

    The VASP INCAR files provided in ``ALL_BASE_FILES/QM_BASEFILES`` for examples using VASP specify either ``NPAR`` or ``NCORE``. These values must be consistent with the resources requested in config.py (i.e., ``VASP_NODES`` * ``VASP_PPN``). For more details, see the VASP documentation for `NPAR <https://www.vasp.at/wiki/index.php/NPAR>`_ and `NCORE <https://www.vasp.at/wiki/index.php/NCORE>`_.

.. Warning ::

    QM codes can fail to converge in unexpected cases, in manners that are challenging to detect. If you notice your force parity plots indicate generally good model performance but show a few unexpected outliers, verify your QM code is providing the correct answer. This can be done by evaluating the offending configuration with a different code version or a different code altogether.
