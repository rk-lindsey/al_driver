If spinx-build is missing, you can install it via:

pip install -U sphinx
pip install -U sphinx_rtd_theme

Then update the Makefile to point to your installation.

If you are on a machine that requires a virutal environment to install python packages, you can do this via virtual environments.
For example, on the LLNL LC, you would execute:
  
/usr/tce/packages/python/python/bin/virtualenv --system-site-packages ~/
~/bin/pip install -U sphinx
~/bin/pip install -U sphinx_rtd_theme

And then set SPHINXBUILD   = ~/bin/sphinx-build in the Makefile
